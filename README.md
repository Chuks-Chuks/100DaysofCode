# 100 Days of Code
Here I would deposit the codes I will learn throughout the course of the coding bootcamp.

Day One

For day one I have learned on how to use the print function. This will enable me to print codes/results on the 
console.
# print()

Also, the input function. This is where the data entered by a user is saved after being prompted by the computer.
# input()

Finally, the rules on variable naming was covered.
Variable naming is simply the method items are named. The guidelines were also covered. For example:
Variables are not titled and are all in lower cases (beginner level--which this entry is for).
 # user = prisca ✅
 # User = prisca ❌

 Also, if multiple names was to be used then an underscore is to be used in between the words. 
# user_one = prisca
# user_1 = prisca 
The last example is also an acceptable form of naming variables as integers (another fancy word for numbers) can be
used alongside letters. 

CHALLENGE FOR THE DAY:
Build a name generator. 

KEY TIPS:
The name generator is to use:
- The user input to receive the data for naming the band. 
- Use the print function
